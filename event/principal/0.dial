[narr]Dallas. It seems that the city is well organized. No chaos, no argue, but... there is actually nobody, not even a car in the middle of the road.
Some roads are closed by several concrete blocks and military barricades, leaving only one possible road. 
[main]It's so calm! I can't believe it... The U.S. army finally took control of a city!
[narr]You approach a huge military portal where '1B' is wroten it. The site looks closed and nobody watches from the little tower on the side.
[main]'1B'? What is that?
[narr]After a while, contemplating the portal with the bus engine still running, there is nobody.
[main]Alright, and now?
