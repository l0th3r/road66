[narr]Your brother is beaten up by madmen.
You feel a strong sense of guilt and bitterness.
But there is nothing you can do.
With tears in your eyes, you run to the car.
[main]Sorry brother.
[narr]The car is too damaged. It won't move, but your instinct tells you to check if there is ammunition in the glove-box.
[main]Hell yeah! Thank you <char0>.
[narr]You find a box of ammunition, more than you need.
