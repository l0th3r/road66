[narr]You stop the bus and go out, nobody seems to care about the crash or even you. 
The car is overturned and a fire starts to spread.
There is no sign of the driver. 
Powerless in the face of this situation, you go back to the bus and keep driving. 

Only a few seconds after, you hear an explosion. 
It was the car that you hit. 
Feeling bad and guilty, you stop the bus and keep looking at the car burning in the mirror. 
[main]Shit!
What did I do?!
