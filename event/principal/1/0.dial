[main]Las Vegas... What the hell happened here? It looks shit.
[narr]You can tell just by looking at it, something really bad happened here. Not to say it's a deserted city. Shops, markets, everything has been ravaged or looted. The only people here are trapped in an ill-famed city in the middle of the desert.
Dealers, pick-pocketing, fights... This is what the city is composed of.
[main]Homeless and gangs, seriously? 
Fuck, where are the army forces?!
