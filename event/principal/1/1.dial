[narr]It's not so easy to find your way on the city's roads among the wastes and the abandoned cars. 
Some people ignore your presence, some others look at you with envy, as if you were just walking past like a corrupt politician in his luxury armoured car.

Driving slowly in the city centre, a group of people is approaching you and blocking your way.
Stopping the bus, you understand that you're surrounded.
