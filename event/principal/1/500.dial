[narr]The <char2> is on fire.
Tyler and Angel are turning around expecting the first hit.
...
Here we go! Angel jumps and throws two kick jabs in Tyler's jawbone.
Tyler seized him to avoid being hit and knees him very hard.
Angel headbutts him and Tyler's nose is bleeding.
After a few hooks, jabs, kicks, Angel lough a bit under adrenaline. In the arena, we may smell blood mixed to sweat.
Tyler throws a high kick and Angel falls on the ground.
A merciless struggle begins with hands and feet.
