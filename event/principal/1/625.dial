[narr]You grab his nake but <char4> doesn't blink. He looks at you with amused eyes. He throws you a spectacular back kick to the plexus and finished it with a well-aimed knee kick. 
There is blood on your knuckles and a bruise above your right eye, yet you can't recall the fight itself. 
While keeping a distance that is difficult to pierce, <char4> chains a series of overhand and crochet moves to make the reading of his moves less predictable.
