[narr]While <char4> executes a series of hooks to weaken your guard, you take advantage of the fact that he chambers a punch to execute a low-kick right on his diaphragm. 
<char4> moves his chest and trunk back to avoid this kind of manoeuvre and positions his head further forward to keep the pressure on you. 
Leaving his head unable to absorb blows without neutralizing his entire defensive posture, you jumping up a knee kick on the chin. The knee strike removes <char4> and completely neutralizes his defensive posture. 
Both hands are positioned on his chin and leave you free to move.
