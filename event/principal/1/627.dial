[narr]You arm your kick so that it comes crashing down on <char4>'s face. Your kick comes down violently on this bugger. <char4> twirls to come crashing down a little further, with a haggard look in his eyes. 
The impact that hit his temple must have stunned him. Getting back on his feet, he begins to fail. Tangling on one side, his breathing intensifies as if trying to stay awake as much as possible. 
His foot placement and toe-Heel alignment is disorderly and, more than that, he remains motionless as if trying to preserve the little energy that seems to remain. <char4> remains standing out of misplaced pride but clearly has no strength left.
