[narr]Coming down like a rock, the kick knocks <char4> unconscious and immediately leaves him unconscious on the ground. 
The countdown is heard. The audience counts in rhythm in a cheer that intensifies with each second of the countdown. Despite a short recovery of consciousness <char4> seems to remain passively on the ground, conceding you this victory. 
The delirious crowd cheers your name with enthusiasm.
