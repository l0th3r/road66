[narr]You perform a perfect dropkick that knocks <char4> out of the ring by knocking the crowd right behind him like the pins in a bowling alley. 
Surprisingly, the crowd seems to appreciate this action by kicking <char4> down in the middle of the crowd. The bell-ringing the end of the fight was not long in coming, leaving <char4> at the mercy of the crowd. 
A few insults and banging noises reverberate on the walls of the room.
