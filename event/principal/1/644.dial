[narr]You reach out and hold <char4>'s neck firmly with both hands. There is no resistance except for a few spasms that will punctuate his choking. 
You feel the tension suddenly break, signifying that he had fainted as if his body had let go of the pressure. His face is a scarlet red from which a few tears that the strangulation has made pearl will run down his swollen face. 
The outcome of a rather unspectacular fight to the public's taste reminding its last ones of the emptiness of it all. A jolt, a dark reminder of the fatality that accompanies such festivities. 
Assuring you in passing that <char4> was still alive, you leave the arena without a word, leaving this dark omen of a non-existent future in suspense. 
For you as for all these people.
