[narr]When faced with <char4> in violent pain, you give him a violent kick to the forehead. The bugger roars in pain, tears mingle with foam, choking. You position yourself on <char4> and start beating him up. 
Afterwards, his split face takes on the purplish colour of a corned beef. Your blows intensify then, moved by a rage that was unknown to you until then. 
In the end, the poor man won't look like much identifiable. A silence tinged with admiration can be felt in the room. A blissful silence that is reserved for strangeness, for fairground monsters. 
This is followed by a shower of applause, clapping and the numbness in your hands.
