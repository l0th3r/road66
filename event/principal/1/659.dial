[narr]You knock him off his knees. <char4> is desperately trying to get up but you hold him firmly with your shoulder. 
The situation is reversed. The passing minutes seem like hours. The room is silent. No speeches, no panting action, just a man trying to breathe and slowly asphyxiating himself. You feel <char4>'s resistance cease. 
The tension holding his muscles, his hand squeezing you in an attempt to defuse your grip and his livid eyes confirm that the man is indeed knocked out. 
This is followed by clamour and congratulations from the audience in a cacophony without common measure.
