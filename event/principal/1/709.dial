[narr]It's unexpected but you launch this backflip because of the drug effect and not because of your skill. You jump in the air and rotate to the back with your feet launched at full power in direction of the jawbone of <char4> but you miss him.
When you fall, you twist your neck and feel very bad. <char4> laugh out loud of you. 
[char4]That's it?! THAT'S IT?!
[char2]Yeah! <char4>! <char4>!
[narr]You feel too bad to stand up again and it's obvious that you can't fight anymore.
TAP TAP. You abandon.
[narr]The delirious crowd cheers <char4> with enthusiasm.
