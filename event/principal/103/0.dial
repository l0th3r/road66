[narr]In the middle of the Mohave plains, you see a man dressed in a spacesuit. He looks completely stoned, has difficulty standing but still manages to wave at you. You stop at his level and open the bus door.
[char0]Look, man. It's the fucking end of the world, and I'm having one of those cravings for a little French-style pigeon.
[main]Where do you need to go?
[char0]Albuquerque, pal.
[main]Why do you need to go to New Mexico to eat french pigeon?
[char0]Did you know that my uncle was not attacked by pigeons when he was a kid? Just like in the Hitchcock movie, man. It's crazy, right?
