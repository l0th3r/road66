[main]Alright! Alright! Don't shoot.
[narr]You get out of the bus and someone seems to recognize you.
[char0]Lower your arm! It's <main>!
[main]Mh?! <char0>?!
[narr]He runs to take you in his arms.
[main]Brother! I don't have the words... How? I thought you were dead!
[char0]It's not so easy to kill an old soldier, isn't it?
Aah, <main>, I finally found you! I'm so glad to see you here.
Come, we have to talk.
