[narr]The guy stops crying and looks at you. 
[char1]What the fuck? 
Yes, I do smoke! Why?
[narr]You grab a cigarette pack from your pocket. You still have 2 cigarettes in it and you raise your hand to show it to the guy. 
[main]Mate, here! Come with me to discuss! 
[narr]The guy sniffs and rubs his sleeve on the face to dry his tears. He takes a breath... Wait for a while... 
And moves away from the edge of the building. The guy joins you and his hands are shaking. Coming to you, you kindly smile and give him a cigarette. 
[char1]Thank you.
