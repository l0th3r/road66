[narr]Back to the closed area, <char0> comes to you.
[main]Two ammunition boxes for mister. <char4> is a kind guy.
[char0]And very odd, right?
[main]As odd as he’s old!
[narr]Laughing, <char0> gives you a tap on the shoulder.
[main]However, you told me that we’ll only infiltrate, isn’t it?
[char0]Don’t worry, it should be alright. It’s only a matter of security if we cross the path of someone.
