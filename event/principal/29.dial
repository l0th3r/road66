[char1]Listen, <main>. All of this was done for you.
[main]What?
[char1]Everything was planned because your name was called. The bus and the message saying that Oklahoma was safe... All of that, since the beginning, was just a staging. Like me, you are here to help.
[narr]You are confused and begin to whisp to yourself.
[main]What the fuck... there is no sence...
And what if the patient killed you this day, <char1>? Did you plan this?
[char1]It was a risk to take.
[main]Did Rafe know about you?
[char1]He would kill me if he knew. However, our duty and destiny are never compromised, because we're faithful.
[main]SHUT THE FUCK UP! Your words have no sense!
