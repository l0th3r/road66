[narr]You see a sign announcing Kingman. After all these adventures, you hope that this time you can breathe a bit. But when you see the first buildings in ruins in the distance, you are quickly disillusioned. After driving for almost an hour in this deserted city, you sense that there is a problem with the bus. You stop and walk out. As soon as you put your foot on the ground you notice that hundreds of points are strewn on the ground. They appear to have been placed there on purpose. Of course, all four of your tires are flat. You sigh and address to passengers.

[main]The tires are all flat. I saw some car wrecks earlier, I'm going to go for a ride and hopefully find some usable tires
[narr]You go towards the city centre, telling yourself that you will have a better chance of finding a bus there. After walking for ten minutes or so without having seen a living soul, you hear footsteps behind you.
