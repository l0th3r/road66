[narr]Used to bad meetings, you instinctively try to outrun the people behind you, whoever they are. You suddenly hear a gunshot and a bullet passes 10 centimeters from your ear. You get the message, you raise your hands and slowly turn around. You barely have time to see the gunman when he hits you with his pistol-grip and everything goes black.
You wake up in a sordid room. A woman with two gorillas looks at you.
[char0]So, shall we wake up?!
[main]Where am I? Who are you?
[char1]I'm Caitlyn, chief of this clan and you are in my HQ, in the western part of Kingman, my town.
