[main]And you, tell me your story.
[char3]Nothing happen in my life. Daddy always keeps me in my room and tell me that that the outside is dangerous and that if I go out I will die.
[main]How is he treating you? Has he ever hurt you?

[narr]She starts yawning.
[main]Ok, time to sleep.
[char3]Can I sleep with you?
