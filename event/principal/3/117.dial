[char3]What do you want to know?
[main]I don't know, speak about yourself.
[char3]Uh... I have nothing to say... Nothing happened in my life. Daddy always keeps me in my room and tell me that that the outside is dangerous and that if I go out I will die.
[main]How was he with you? Has he ever hurt you?
[char3]Never, but he always scared me. He changed his mood all the time. He used to give me gifts sometimes but I never really felt like he loved me.
[narr]She started yawning.
[main]Ok, time to sleep.
char3]Can I sleep with you?
