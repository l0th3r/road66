[narr]You decide to bring Claire back to her father. The child doesn't seem very happy but maybe it's better for her than Caitlyn.
[char2]You're very smart, and I'm very grateful to you. I'll help you fix your bus and you can take as much gas and food as you want with you!
[narr]With troops of Clifford's soldier, you return to your bus with your booty. A shootout begins between the men of Caitlyn and Clifford, but thanks to the numerical superiority of the latter, you win and manage to leave with your bus in good condition and with all its passengers. You are leaving Kingman, probably forever.
