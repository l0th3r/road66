[narr]After a short jeep ride, you continue on foot through the deserted town for a full hour until you see the Clifford repair. In any case, according to the words of your guides: the building looks like all the others and there doesn't seem to be people outside.
[char4]We won't go further. Go ahead, we'll leave when you get to the building. And don't forget that we have your bus and its occupantsâ€™ hostage.
[narr]You walk towards the building. As you approach, you find that there is a guard in front of the door. You hear a heavy metal door slam and see another guard coming from behind the building. There must be a door at the back.
