[narr]Hoping to find locals, your hopes quickly fly away when you realize that an armed and menacing man is facing you. He walks up to you and raises his gun.
[main]No, no, no!

[char0]So, shall we wake up?!
[main]Where am I? Who are you?
[char1]I'm Lynn, chief of this clan and you are in my headquarters, in the western part of Kingman, my town.
