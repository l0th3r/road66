[narr]One of the gorillas hit you in the stomach. In shock, you fold in half, breathless. Caitlyn raises her chin dismissively and continues.
[char1]Normally this town is mine, and I had gained the advantage when Clifford managed to get hold of my only daughter, Claire. Now I find myself bound hand and foot.
[main]And is that why you need me?
[char1]That's it. Nobody knows you here. My squad is shrinking and I don't want to risk losing more. So I want to offer you a deal. You're going to have to infiltrate Clifford's headquarters and get Claire back. Also, I am not ungrateful, if you succeed I will repair your bus and give you food and gas, enough to travel serenely to Phoenix.
