[main]Hi... Something to tell me about this mission? Your boss didn't give me much info.
[char4]Yeah, I have some information for you. As you can imagine, the building is full of guards, and they will be armed. I think you can try to sneak around, either by disguising yourself as a guard or simply by being discreet. I will show you something that will help you.
[narr]He teach you how to picks simples locks.
[char4]If you want to live, be careful, maybe some little mistakes won't betray you, but if you accumulate then, you surely will have a bad surprise.
[narr]Thanks for the advice.
[char4]Your welcome, you are nice to me.
