[narr]You see a sign announcing Kingman. After all these adventures, you hope that this time you can breathe a bit. But when you see the first buildings in ruins in the distance, you are quickly disillusioned. After driving for almost an hour in this deserted city, you sense that there is a problem with the bus. You stop and walk out. As soon as you put your foot on the ground you notice that hundreds of points are strewn on the ground. They appear to have been placed there on purpose. Of course, all four of your tires are flat. You sigh and address to passengers.
[main]The tires are all flat. I saw some car wrecks earlier, I'm going to go for a ride and hopefully find some usable tires
[narr]You go towards the city centre, telling yourself that you will have a better chance of finding a bus there. After walking for ten minutes or so without having seen a living soul, you hear footsteps behind you.

	0 - Run without looking back.
	// 1
	1 - Turn around.

(#1)

[narr]Used to bad meetings, you instinctively try to outrun the people behind you, whoever they are. You suddenly hear a gunshot and a bullet passes 10 centimeters from your ear. You get the message, you raise your hands and slowly turn around. You barely have time to see the gunman when he hits you with his pistol-grip and everything goes black.
You wake up in a sordid room. A woman with two gorillas looks at you.
[char0]So, shall we wake up?!
[main]Where am I? Who are you?
[char1]I'm Caitlyn, chief of this clan and you are in my headquarters, in the western part of Kingman, my town.

	0 - Ok... and what are you going to do with me? I'm alone and I have nothing to give you...
	// 3
	1 - I don't give a fuck about that, I just want to know if you have a good reason to do this to me!
	// 4

—————————————————————————————————————————————

(#2)

[narr]Hoping to find locals, your hopes quickly fly when you realize that an armed and menacing man is facing you. He walks up to you and raises his gun.
[main]No, no, no!
[narr]He hits you with his pistol-grip and you pass out.
You wake up in a sordid room. A woman with two gorillas looks at you.
[char0]So, shall we wake up?!
[main]Where am I? Who are you?
[char1]I'm Lynn, chief of this clan and you are in my headquarters, in the western part of Kingman, my town.

(#3)

[char1]Don't lie to me, I know you just arrived by bus, that you have blown your tires out on our anti-intrusion system and that you have quite a few resources. But don't worry, I'm not going to take all of this from you. However, I have a favour to ask you. Follow me.
[narr]You get up and follow Caitlyn into a large room where all the local scum and banditry looks like. You even see military equipment.
[char1]You see, Kingman is my town. In fact, just half. The other is possessed by Clifford. This motherfucker and I go head-to-head for total control of the city.

	0 - Are you the one who put the city in this state?
	// 5
	1 - Yeah so it's not your city at all.
	// 6

[char1]I advise against being disrespectful, you are not in a position to be smart. that you have blown your tires out on our anti-intrusion system and that you have quite a few resources. But don't worry, I'm not going to take all of this from you. However, I have a favour to ask you. Follow me.

(#5)

[char1]It takes what it takes. 
[narr]Caitlyn raises her chin dismissively and continues.
[char1]Normally this town is mine, and I had gained the advantage when Clifford managed to get hold of my only daughter, Claire. Now I find myself bound hand and foot.
[main]And is that why you need me?
[char1]That's it. Nobody knows you here. My squad is shrinking and I don't want to risk losing more. So I want to offer you a deal. You're going to have to infiltrate Clifford's headquarters and get Claire back. Also, I am not ungrateful, if you succeed I will repair your bus and give you food and gas, enough to travel serenely to Phoenix.

	0 - But you're crazy, that sounds really dangerous! Find yourself someone else!
	// 7
	1 - Mmmm... I'm up for it, but you better keep your promise!

[narr]One of the gorillas hit you in the stomach. In shock, you fold in half, breathless. Caitlyn raises her chin dismissively and continues.

(#7)

[char1]I suspected such an answer, but I'm afraid I won't give you a choice. If you refuse, don't even hope to find a piece of your bus or its passengers. And of course, you will lose your life as a bonus.

[narr]After a short jeep ride, you continue on foot through the deserted town for a full hour until you see the Clifford repair. In any case, according to the words of your guides: the building looks like all the others and there doesn't seem to be people outside.
[char4]We won't go further. Go ahead, we'll leave when you get to the building. And don't forget that we have your bus and its occupants’ hostage.
[narr]You walk towards the building. As you approach, you find that there is a guard in front of the door. You hear a heavy metal door slam and see another guard coming from behind the building. There must be a door at the back.

In case they come outside, you hurry back to the entrance dragging the body of the guard and leaving it in the shade of the building, behind a barrel.

(#37)

[narr]You continue in a corridor until you reach a door. You hear voices from the other side. You enter and then come across a group of people leaning over a map. One of them explains something to the others. This person looks up and you notice a large red mark on his face like a burn but which would have remained bright red. You are facing Clifford, the Big Red Dog.
[char2]What's the matter?

[char2]I'm going to save her from this woman-like monster. My child will never be in danger. Now get out before I decide to make sure that you never bother us again.

	1 - Take the corridor.
	// 67


—————————————————————————————————————————————

	// 51
	1 - Keep moving forward.
	// 52


—————————————————————————————————————————————

—————————————————————————————————————————————

(#53)

[narr]You arrive again above a room where a group is discussing. But this time the discussion seems more important. You look through the slits in the grid and spot a man with a bright red profile, which gives you good reason to believe it is Clifford, the Big Red Dog.
[char2]...and with that, victory is assured, ah ah!
[char5]And about Caitlyn? If she tries to take Claire while we are attacking her repair?
[char2]Don't worry about that. I don't think my daughter will be her priority if we are killing all her troops.
[narr]You are a little surprised by what you have just heard. Caitlyn lied to you? You decide to continue but the conduit stops directly after the room. You want to turn around to turn back but it might make some noise.

(#56)

[narr]They end up leaving the room. You go back to the fork and take the other direction. After passing through a few rooms, you feel the duct squeak and move. Suddenly it breaks and you find yourself in the room below. A guy is watching you wide-eyed. He tries to take a gun out of his pocket.

[char5]You shouldn't take me for a jerk.

	// GAME OVER

[narr]After you apply your plan, you stand against the doorframe, plank in hand. You strain your ears and listen to the guard slowly approaching. Despite his suspicion, you pick up speed when he gets to your level and smashes him with your plank. You take his keys and head for the door.

[narr]Thanks to your discretion, no one seems to be actively looking for you. You take the child on your back and exit the room. You walk silently through the building.

[narr]You freeze. But the child, until now silent, sees a spider slowly descending from the ceiling. You also see her and gesture to the kid not to make noise. But that is in vain: by reflex, she screams. You jump on the chair and use it to block the door as the guy on the other side calls for reinforcements.

[narr]You go into the city, avoiding turning your back on them for the first few hundred meters. You pick up the kid on your back. After a few hours of walking, the night starts to come and you feel really tired. You decide to stop for the knight in a ruined house where you found an old mattress.
