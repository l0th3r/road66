[narr]The great herbaceous steppes of Arizona loom on the horizon.  Surrounded by imposing mountainous reefs like a pearl in a jewel case. Places are becoming more and more urbanized. You are close to Phoenix as the signs say. But the little traffic on the road makes you realize that heading downtown is not the best idea. No local radio seems to be broadcasting.

Among the buildings that succeed one another, there is one in particular that catches your attention. The BiologicalÂ Resource Center. A beautiful, well-maintained building whose architecture is in keeping with all the other buildings you have seen so far. Like blocks that have been stacked on which are carved geometric shapes similar to palm trees.
