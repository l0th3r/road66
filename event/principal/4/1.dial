[narr]A series of desks lined up from one end of the room to the other. Always richly decorated, a painting catches your attention. Hunger, madness and crime by Antoine Wiertz.  A child-eating woman as the subject of a painting. Of rather dubious taste. Not the kind of painting you would expect to find on this side of the Atlantic, nor specifically in a research center.
