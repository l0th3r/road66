[narr]When you open the drawers that contain the bodies, you are ironically quite surprised that they are occupied. And strangely enough, some of them look quite fresh. Their deaths are quite recent.  

But what will surprise you more than anything else is that some of the bodies are completely mutilated or amputated. Arm, leg, some muscles have been dislodged. A corpse is enucleated. You are not a doctor, but everything suggests that this is not the procedure used for an autopsy.
