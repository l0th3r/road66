[narr]The building is divided into several parts like a university campus. In the center are gardens with tropical accents: palm trees, bamboos, pecan walnut and other exotic and colorful flowers.

You enter the center's premises and head towards its entrance hoping to find medical resources. Medication may even be food given the size of the center.

As you enter the building in the center, you will discover a finely decorated hall. The brutalist architecture and art deco furniture gives the impression of being completely elsewhere. Between two different temporalities, similar to a post-war science fiction novel.

There is no one here, yet the place seems to be maintained. The hall in which you are standing can be broken down quite simply. There is a reception behind which are administrative offices and two other accesses leading to the laboratories.
