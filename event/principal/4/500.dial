[narr]The charcoal black marble walls counterbalanced by the midnight blue cabinet underlined by the gold contours give this room a timeless look. Isolation or autarky, this piece seems to illustrate the old man sitting in front of you. Behind the fancy grey suit is an aging man. His withered skin forms many asperities, delimiting the contours of his face.

The man takes out of one of his bar furniture a bottle of Dalmore set with a silver stag on top. From here you can smell the scent of whisky: spicy and sweet at the same time. He serves two glasses and places one on the coffee table in front of you.
[char0]I thought I heard that one of my collaborators spoke to you.
[narr]Taking a sip of whisky, he sinks into his armchair.
[char0]I'll be very direct with you.
[narr]I was told that we had to be very direct with you. I was asked to be direct with you.
