[narr]The mountainous and wooded reefs typical of the region. The city center, devoid of activity, reveals fragments of dramatic events behind the silence. Like a treasure hunt (paper chase?) that could be traced from one track to another. Some tourist shuttles at the stop. In direction of Colorado. No wonder, though, it's not really the right time for tourism. In the distance you see the imposing Flagstaff shopping center. A provincial shopping mall as you can see so many of them all over the country. No trace of activity. The place is in a decent state considering everything that's been going on lately. You enter the shopping center.
