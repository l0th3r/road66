[char0]Ah <main>, how glad I am to see you!
[narr]You both enter a little basement in the area. <char0> sighs, something seems to bother him and fixes you with a deep look.
[main]Is something wrong?
[char0]I don't know... I mean, yes.
[main]Listen, <char0> I'm really sorry. I thought you were dead! I... I didn’t...
[char0]No, don't worry. All of that is not your fault. No need to talk about it.
[main]But... Why are you with these masked guys?!
[char0]It's a lure, most of them are from the US army forces and are my friends.
[main]A lure for what? And why are you here? I still can’t believe it to find you here, so far from Los Angeles while I thought you were dead.
[char0]So do I?
