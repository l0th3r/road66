[char0]I told you that we had to leave Los Angeles but I'm even not sure where we could be safe...
Dallas has become a crossing point, a sort of custom to reach the East Coast. After the Los Angeles ambush, I called an old colleague of military service to help me.
Fortunately, I still have a good reputation in this entourage and I was helicoptered two days ago to capture this crossing point. In some ways, I could say that I resumed service.
[narr]You listen to <char0> attentively and surprised by what he’s saying.
[char0]Actually, the East Coast seems safe but not for a long time. Reinforcements for ambush should come to Oklahoma City and start to seize more cities.
[main]Damn... We are finished!
[char0]No we are not. Well, do you still have my gun?
[main]Yes, I do. You sound like if you had a bad idea, I don’t like that.
[char0]Great, you'll need it.
