[char0]Well, he’s <char1> and she’s <char2>, they’ll help us for this mission. Guys, I’m the <main>’s big brother.
[narr]Without a word they nod to you.
[char0]Here, one mask for each of you. Keep it to don’t reveal your identity and keep in mind to avoid the faithf... cultist.
[narr]The word Faithful clears the <char0>’s throat when saying it by mistake. You quickly look at the mask he gives you. It’s white and mat, with a hole for each eye. It looks like a statue visage, without expression. The word LIKE is painted on it, with paint drips. However, it looks very well made. 
[char0]If we are confronted by them and it’s too dangerous to attack, tell them that we are here for reinforcement.
[narr]You stay quiet, with a beating heart. Now, it’s too late to back down. It’s not a matter of what you can do but only what is going to happen when you will be at Lawton.
You arrive near Lawton and there are masked guys that control the entry of the city.
[main]Oh no, <char0>! Do I turn around?
[char0]Fuck! Don’t, it’s too late. It would be suspect and they would chase us. Keep drive in their direction. Everybody put on his mask!
