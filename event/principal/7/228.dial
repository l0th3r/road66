[char1]Fuck!
[main]He’s dead!
[char1]I don’t think so. They just found a way to scramble our conversation. Listen to me <main>, the mission is not over and I have to check if they are okay.

[main]Explosives? What the fuck?! You really want me dead!
[char1]Two minutes...
[narr]He gives you the bag and leaves to find <char0> and <char2>.
