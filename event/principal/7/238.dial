[char4]There is no need to elaborate, Miller. I’m waiting for you in the school with your brother. I’m glad that I’ll finally meet you.
[narr]The palpitation increases again. A dark intuition takes shape in your mind. An indelible mark that emerges from the depths of your consciousness as an invisible presence that declares itself to you today. Without really knowing why, you are convinced that it is the Great Preacher who is at the other end of the line. His ataraxic voice puts you in a stupor similar to that of a prey in front of its predator. You are the object of a will that surpasses you. You try as hard as you can to keep your cool and make sure you talk as confidently as possible, but you know these efforts are useless.
I gave the order to not kill you. Please join us, Miller.
