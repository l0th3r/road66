[narr]An alarm begins to ring loudly in Lawton.
[char3]Shit! We’re attacked! WE ARE ATTACKED!
[narr]You are dropped on the ground and the city ambiance immediately turns to the battlefield. Gunshots, explosions, rifles, fumigenes... bullets whistles in all directions without knowing where you could shelter.
A <char3> aims you. Even before he has time to shoot, he’s brutally thrown by the force of the fired bullets which pass through his body like a knife in butter.

You try to run hidden behind every obstacle, wall and car and try to reach your bus, but at the end of the street, you see it destroyed.
Another masked guy slams you down and punches you. Struggling, he stands up and grabs a knife from his belt.
