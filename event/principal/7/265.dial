[main]Oklahoma City. Finally! Guys, we finally did it!
[narr]The sun rises over the city. Dazzling and warm, you already feel at home. Itâ€™s a pleasure to see a city with an almost common life, without aggression and gunshot in the streets.
By the window, you may see some civilians acclaiming in your direction.
[main]Is that common?
[char2]You saved Oklahoma City and probably other cities because of you this night. You are heroes. All vehicles coming back from Lawton will be acclaimed as heroes.
