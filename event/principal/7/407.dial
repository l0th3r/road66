[char2]We won't give you a choice, mate. You'll have a better chance than us of reaching Oklahoma. Assume it's a pragmatic choice and that we still need you.
[narr]The night passes but sleep doesn't seem to dawn on him. Your noisy thoughts jostling around leaving you with no respite, at the mercy of new guilt and responsibility. Like every morning, the jailers come to hammer the bars to wake up the prisoners. Psalmodizing their hymn, revering their Great Preacher, insulting and humiliating the latecomers and finally tearing us out of our cells. You may have noticed on your way to the workshop that indeed, the fanatics were more active than usual. An impression that will be verified when you are in the workshop making ammunition. Today, their directives are more virulent than usual. In front of you, <char2> looks at you with approval. A fanatic passes by.
[char3]Stop dawdling! What are you up to?! 
Get moving!
