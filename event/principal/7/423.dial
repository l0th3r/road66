[radio]Delta 7, roger! We will take advantage of the arrival of the Great Preacher to send a battalion to Dallas, your ammunition will not be too much if we want to hold out.
[narr]It seems that the arrival of the Great Preacher forces them all to mobilize in Dallas and let their forces present in Lawton be divided. 
[radio]Copy that, Central Lawton. I will arrive within the hour.
[narr]In the distance you can see the church of New Castle. But in addition to the church, you see several jeeps taking the road and converging towards you. As you pass the road, they enter the road and follow you. They don't try to confront you right away, obviously, they follow you.
