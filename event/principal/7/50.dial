[narr]Another day passes. You are starving, lying on the floor. Waiting... Again...
[main]I... I don't want to die... Brother, if only you were here.
[narr]A breath of survival instinct comes to you, recovering a bit of energy.
[main]I'm gonna break this fucking post!
[narr]You pull on it as hard as you can. Yelling and spending all your remaining energy. The post creaks but it doesn't give way.
[main]Fuck! FUCK! I can't break it alone...
