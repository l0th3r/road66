[radio]I am nothing less than humanity's desire for peace and apathy. Can you feel it, Miller, this bond we share? You are my child and you are destined to serve humanity. You are my receptacle, the instrument of a desire for ataraxy. You will understand.
[narr]These words resound in you like a sweet melody. A vow you share, a great work of which you are a part, but something within you defies this logic and this wishful thinking. Something that remains and makes you resist this temptation.
