[narr]It's midnight, the moon is high. Hiding in the farm, you wait for the signal before acting.
After a few minutes, you notice a blinking light in the horizon.
You move with your companion in arms silently, heading to the airport.
On your arrival, you are welcomed with heavy eyes, relieving yet.
Itâ€™s finally time for revenge, payback will be checked soon.
You ask if the airplane is ready.
It is.
You discover a can of paint on the workbench and you may write something on the plane before it takes off.
