[char1]No more than you. All these cult stories have taken a most unexpected turn. I'm not into conspiracy theory, but it's hard not to notice that the political spheres have been gangered from the inside. It's quite frightening to see that the influence of the cult is exponential. And above all, who could have financed such a group and why? I doubt that prayers and hymns can enable a band of devotees to get M16 without funding. 
[main]Believe me, the people who funded them didn't know any more than we did that it was going to turn out this way. This whole situation is out of the ordinary.
