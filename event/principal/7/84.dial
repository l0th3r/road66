[narr]Back to the headquarters, in Lawton. At the gate of the school, a few guards are patrolling. They don't even take a look at you and let you enter. 
Inside, you discover an anthill of mens and womens. Preparing weapons and ammos on overpiled workbench.
A speech is about to be done in the gymnasium by the Great Preacher himself.
As you step in and prepare yourself for sitting, everybody says loudly the same sentence at the same time.
[main]On the first day of our journey, we thought that we were home when everything was rotting aside.
[narr]The Great Preacher goes backstage and walks on the scene. He stares at his assembly in a religious silence.
