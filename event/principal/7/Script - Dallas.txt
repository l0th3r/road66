(#0) 

[narr]Dallas. It seems that the city is well organized. No chaos, no argue, but... there is actually nobody, not even a car in the middle of the road.
Some roads are closed by several concrete blocks and military barricades, leaving only one possible road. 
[main]It's so calm! I can't believe it... The U.S. army finally took control of a city!
[narr]You approach a huge military portal where '1B' is wroten it. The site looks closed and nobody watches from the little tower on the side.
[main]'1B'? What is that?
[narr]After a while, contemplating the portal with the bus engine still running, there is nobody.
[main]Alright, and now?

	1 - Honk.
	// 1
	2 - Get out of the bus.
	// 2

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#1) 001		// Honk

[narr]You honk.
...
...
Nobody. You honk again and wait for a while.
...
...
[main]Good! A ghost city, it's better than a civil war. But why is there only this road that we can drive on?
[narr]Around you there are no other possible roads.
[main]I guess that I have to cross this site to go to Oklahoma, the main road is one mile behind it.

	1 - Find a way to open the portal.
	// 3

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#2) 002		// Get out of the bus.

[narr]You get out of the bus, take a long breath and enjoy a fresh and not polluted air.
It's very calm. Nobody is arguing. No gunshot. No car. Nothing, except the little hot breath of Dallas.
Around you there are no other possible roads, this portal is your last chance to cross the city.

	1 - Find a way to open the portal.
	// 3

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#3) 003		// Find a way to open the portal.

[narr]You climb a ladder that allows you to go into the little tower. The metal sound resonates in the street, each step climbed.
Up there, the view overlooks the entire military site. It looks abandoned. The second portal is not so far and you can see a sign which says: 'Oklahoma City 206 miles'.
[main]Bingo!
[narr]Downstair, you begin to slide the very heavy gate. 

	1 - Push the portal.
	// 4

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#4) 004		// Push the portal.


[narr]It makes a lot of noize that resonates loudly among the buildings.
[main]Fuck! It's heavy!
A... again!

	1 - Push harder the portal.
	// 5

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#5) 004.2	// Push harder the portal.

[narr]VLAM!
This action was very noisy by far. Breathless, you go back to your bus.
You enter the army site and slowly drive until the next portal.
In the mirror, you see the portal closing.
[main]What the...?!
[narr]Several armed people arise from nowhere, in the site and on the wall which encircles it. As you have already seen before, they all wear the same kind of white mask.
[char3]Everybody get out of the bus! I will count until three before we shoot!
ONE!

	1 - Stay in the bus.
	// 6
	2 - Get out of the bus.
	// 10

(#8) 007	// (THREE) Evelynn

[narr]The <char3> raises his hand to give order to shoot but suddenly, someone asks to not shoot.
She approaches the bus.
[main]No way... <char1>! Is that you?!
[char1]It's <main>! Don't shoot!
[narr]You get out of the bus and are immediately stunned by a blow of the butt.

	// GO TO 20

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#9) 007.2	// (THREE) Rafe

[narr]The <char3> raises his hand to give order to shoot but suddenly, someone asks to not shoot.
This guy approaches the bus.
[main]No way... <char2>! Is that you?!
[char2]It's <main>! Don't shoot!
[narr]You get out of the bus and <char2> runs to take you in his arms.
[main]Brother! I don't have the words... How? I thought you were dead!
[char2]It's not so easy to kill an old soldier. I finally found you <main>, I'm so glad to see you here!
Come, we have to talk.

	// GO TO 200

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#10) 008	// Get out of the bus. (Evelynn)

[main]Alright! Alright! Don't shoot.
[narr]You get out of the bus and are immediately stunned by a blow of the butt.
...

	// GO TO 20

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#11) 009	// Get out of the bus. (Rafe)

[main]Alright! Alright! Don't shoot.
[narr]You get out of the bus and someone seems to recognize you.
[char0]Lower your arm! It's <main>!
[main]Mh?! <char0>?!
[narr]He runs to take you in his arms.
[main]Brother! I don't have the words... How? I thought you were dead!
[char0]It's not so easy to kill an old soldier, isn't it?
Aah, <main>, I finally found you! I'm so glad to see you here.
Come, we have to talk.

	// GO TO 200

(#21) 100.1 		// LOOSE DIAL

[narr]You wake up with a terrible headache. Your vision is very blurry and your hands are attached to a metal bar. You are alone in a dark room. Only a small halo of light is piercing throughout the dusty room. The air is full of moisture and difficult to breath.
As you realise how uncomfortable you feel, sticking sweat dripping from your neck, a voice breaks the silence.
[char1]And here we are!
[main]What?! <char1>? Is that you?
[char1]Yes, it was not so easy to find you!
[main]How is that possible... please, untie my links!
[char1]Alas, I can't do that, <main>.
[main]What are you talking about? Don't play with me and untie me!
[char1]I'm not playing with you. 
I see you're tormented, like I was...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#22) 100.2 		// LOOSE DIAL

[narr]You wake up with a terrible pain in your head. Your vision is very blurry and your hands are attached together. You are with the other passenger that was with you in the bus, still stunned, in this dirty room.
[char1]And here we are!
[main]What?! <char1>? Is that you?
[char1]Yes, it was not so easy to find you!

	// GO TO 24
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#24)	101	// What are you doing here?

[char1]I'm not playing with you. 
I see you're tormented, like I was... But I'm here to help, <main>!
You know, I'm glad that you survived to come here.

	1 - Who do you wanna help?
	// 26

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#26)	103	// Who do you wanna help?

[narr]Approaching you, <char1> kneels in front of you and smiles.
[char1]I help the United States America.
[main]Are you losing your mind?
[char1]You just have to be... faithful, <main>.
[main]Your words have no meaning!
[char1]So you are a fool.

	1 - Please, help me. Untie my links!
	// 27

(#28)	104	// How did you survive in the hospital?

[char1]I was sheltered during the explosion.
[main]No way! The explosion destroyed everything, the whole fucking hospital!
[char1]...
[narr]She is looking at you, waiting for your reflexion.
[main]Did you run outside?
[char1]Think again, be faithful.
[narr]With a look accusing, you understand.
[main]No... no... you didn't set this bomb.
[char1]I did.
[main]WHAT THE HELL, <char1>?! Is that your way to do your bereavement? You lost your fucking mind...
[char1]Never mind... It's done. Rafe's death was the price to pay.

	2 - Struggle to break the links.
	// 30
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#29)	105	// How dare you?!

[char1]Listen, <main>. All of this was done for you.
[main]What?
[char1]Everything was planned because your name was called. The bus and the message saying that Oklahoma was safe... All of that, since the beginning, was just a staging. Like me, you are here to help.
[narr]You are confused and begin to whisp to yourself.
[main]What the fuck... there is no sence...
And what if the patient killed you this day, <char1>? Did you plan this?
[char1]It was a risk to take.
[main]Did Rafe know about you?
[char1]He would kill me if he knew. However, our duty and destiny are never compromised, because we're faithful.
[main]SHUT THE FUCK UP! Your words have no sense!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#62)	120

[narr]You feel like you lose the notion of time. Your clothes, full of dirt, are now soaking wet and your head tilts, until you hear a sound.
You don't make a move before realising it's <char1>. She's not making herself wait and open your cell.
You raise your head with a burning wish of killing her. By looking at her like, she is nothing but a dog on a leash, you quickly find out that she brings something to you : a plate.
A beautiful smell invades your nostrils, both appetizing and succulente, even if you are just staring at it. Your belly is teeming with rumbling sounds and your saliva is filling your mouth.
Anger rises indeed but starvation is calling, begging you to eat.
[char1]On the first day of our journey, we thought that we were home when everything was rotting aside.
[main]What the fuck are you barging, bitch?
[narr]As she heard your answer, she leaves the place and throws the food on the wall. Breaking both your meal and the plate in a thunderous noise. The food is spread on the floor as well as its perfume. It seems you have to be satisfied with this for the day... You start to pick a nap but release that you can't sleep like this. Your wounds on your wrist are painful.
...
Maybe tomorrow will be different?

1- Yes.
// 63
2- No.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#63)	121

[narr]You wake up like a jolt, hearing gun fights in the distance. You take a look around, hoping that someone is going to help you to leave this place. Your waits are shortened by footsteps, like they are running, getting closer and closer. Your heart beats accelerate.
[main]Please, help me! I'm here!
[narr]The footsteps are getting closer. Finally help! In the dark, you succeed to identify the door opening. Without seeing anything, you hear someone entering. Your lack of understanding is making you talk.
[main]Please... Free me from this hell's place...
[char1]As you wish.
[narr]You receive a push in your face.
[main]What are...?
[narr]Then another one.
[main]Stop!
[narr]A kick in your ribs...
[main]Help me!
[narr]A kick in your face...
After being beaten up by someone for several minutes, he leaves the place and closes the door. You lose consciousness.

(#64)	122

[narr]You... wake... up... your eyesight is interfering with something. It looks like... blood?
The tears of your awakening let you clear your sight then you find behind the bar a standing shadow. <char1> opens the door with a plate in her hand.
[char1]On the first day of our journey, we thought that we were home when everything was rotting aside.
[main]I don't want to hear it.
[narr]As before, the plate flies throughout the cell before crashing on a wall and leaves the room.

You cannot smell anything anymore... Your wounds had tortured you for so long, you can't even remember to feel happy in any inch of yourself.
One last time, you think... Tomorrow won't be different?

[narr]It's midnight, the moon is high. Hiding in the farm, you wait for the signal before acting.
After a few minutes, you notice a blinking light in the horizon.
You move with your companion in arms silently, heading to the airport.
On your arrival, you are welcomed with heavy eyes, relieving yet.
It's finally time for revenge, payback will be checked soon.
You ask if the airplane is ready.
It is.
You discover a can of paint on the workbench and you may write something on the plane before it takes off.

1- Write: Goodbye.
// 81
2- Write: Freedom.
// 81

[narr]You decide to let it as it is: beautiful.
The plane takes out of the warehouse and you can hear the engine throbbing. The pilot is looking at you and pronouncing his last words, flattened by the noise of the machine.
He saluts everyone with a gesture of the hand and puts on his helmet. The plane takes off at the end of the runaway.
Someone is calling you at your back. You turn around before answering the call with the talkie-walkie. They need you at the church for the assault's preparation.
After a whistle, your team steps up and follows you.

1- We must hurry.
// 82

[narr]You write a word with determination like if you were going to change the world.

[narr]Crossing the city by the streets and sneaking behind the remaining carcass of the cars, you easily manage to reach the church in time.
As you move closer to your location, you hear gunfights in the distance. Stepping from the corner of a building, you discover rebels fighting against members of the cult. They are fighting in the avenue, hidden behind cars.

1- Help the rebels.

[narr]You order your crew to attack.
[main]Kill them!
[narr]The enemies are soon overwhelmed by the ambush and you quickly succeed to kill them all. They thank you and deliver a message to you, that forces you to go to the headquarters.
You search for ammo in the fallen bodies before going to the headquarters.

	1 - Go back to the headquarters.
	// 84

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#84)	141.5

[narr]Back to the headquarters, in Lawton. At the gate of the school, a few guards are patrolling. They don't even take a look at you and let you enter. 
Inside, you discover an anthill of mens and womens. Preparing weapons and ammos on overpiled workbench.
A speech is about to be done in the gymnasium by the Great Preacher itself.
As you step in and prepare yourself for sitting, everybody says loudly the same sentence at the same time.
[main]On the first day of our journey, we thought that we were home when everything was rotting aside.
[narr]The Great Preacher goes backstage and walks on the scene. He stares at his assembly in a religious silence.

1- Kill him.
// 85
2- Applaud.
// 85

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#85)	142

[narr]You stand up from your chair in a flash. Your hands act so quickly that you let the assembly voiceless. Everyone starts to applaud.
The Great Preacher starts his speech and he's handling well his words and invites you to join him on the scene. With a great honor, you go to his side.
He defines you as the one who's gonna save the losts of Oklahoma City. You kneel down and head down to thank him for allowing you to lead the assault.
[main]Only faith will determine how long they'll live.
[narr]You rise and look at the spectators.
[main]It's time to purge the decay of this country my friends! Grab your faith and let's begin the awake!!!
[narr]You raise your arm.
The crowd shouts your praise with a graceful howling.
You get out of the stage looking at your companion of arms as the god of this world.
Your power is indeed indisputable.

1- Time to arm the changing.
// 86

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#86)	143

[narr]You grab an arm and go to the patrol tower.
After a few minutes, everyone is ready to leave.
[main]Let the world change for its own sake.
[narr]You make a sign to the army and leave the city of Lawton.

	1-Go to Oklahoma City.
	//87

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#87)	144

[narr]The cult army is determined and brave. In front of the gate of Oklahoma City, you notice that a huge hall is circling the city.
You receive a call from the plane pilot you met a few days ago to announce that he's ready.
[main]It's time to end this war...
GET INTO THE WALL! THE CHOSEN ONES ASKS!
[narr]Hearing these words, the pilot thanks you.
You order the men, women and childrens to prepare for battle.

	// GO TO 88

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#88)	144.1

[narr]Facing the Oklahoma City's walls, behind you in the sky, the distant sound of an airplane approaches.
[main]Today, we get rid of the dirty daemons. Our faith is bigger than ever! We will be remembered my brothers! Safety will be our reward my sisters! God is watching us, childrens. You make him proud!
WE ARE FAITHFUL AND GOD BLESS AMERICA!
[narr]You put a white mask on your head.
On these words, the plane dives and hits the wall in a deafening sound followed by the howl of a thousand people ready to annihilate the garbage of this world.

	// GO TO 89

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#89)	144.2

[narr]You run to the pierced wall, gun in hand. Crossing the flames and rubbles caused by the crash, several corpses of men, women and childrens are lying in front of you. They are only dust compared to your important duty.
You run on them like if they were nothing to you. Several people are running away in the street above, entrapped by houses.
You aim them and shoot as much as you can, reloading, shooting again...
[main]Charge!
[narr]The army is now infiltrating the city like a blast of air entering a piece and disinfecting it. You move furthermore in the bastion.
However, the backlash of such a thoughtless strategy is rapidly hurting you. A troop of soldiers is making a barricade of shoots on your entrance and you need to act quickly before taking them down.

	1- Attack from the rear.
	// 90
	2- Attack from a roof.
	// 92

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#90)	145

[narr]You call for help and take the street on your left in order to bypass them.
Fortunately, the enemies didn't see you. You hasten to traverse the road and. As you emerge from the corner, you release a powerful holler as you maintain the trigger of your weapon.
The rest of the team reproduces your moves and the barricade falls, however, a woman survives and she begs you to let her alive.

	1- Knock her down.
	//91
	2- Kill her.
	//91

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#91)	146

[narr]You approach her, a smile on your face.
Take the knife of her belt, you kneel on her.
The sharpen tool is opening his throat in a cascade of blood.
[main]Loot them.
[narr]Acting at your demand, you get more ammo than suffisant to erase this nest stinking to high heaven the unfaith.

1-Every heretics should die.
//93

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#92)	147

[narr]You call for help and take on the roof to bypass them.
Fortunately, the enemies don't hear you. You hasten to traverse the house and manage to get to the rooftop. You walk on a couple buildings before emerging from the rooftops.
As you jump off the rooftop, you release a powerful holler and shoot.
The rest of the team reproduces your moves and you all fall down on a barricade that failed.
However, you are facing a soldier woman and she begs you to let her alive.

1- Knock her down.
	//91
	2- Kill her.

(#93)	148

[narr]Not so long ago, you were among these sheeps but you succeeded to become greater than them.
They reap for what they sow.

You are the only one to notice a man entering into a house.

	1- He should die.
	// 94
	2- He should be saved.
	// 94

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#94)	149

[narr]You come at their door but it's locked. You don't take more time than it needs to shoot the handle. Once inside, the entrance is basic and representative of the level of means that the population can afford.
A noise is emitted from your left, where you can see stairs and a living room.

	1- Head for the first floor by taking the stairs.
	//95

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#95)	150

Going upstairs, you found nothing except empty rooms but you may hear whines coming from a child room. The room is full of brilliant colors and toys are scattered all around the room.
You move them aside with your steps and keep looking for a possible hideout.
The noise seems to come from a bright wood cupboard.

	1- Release your faith.
	//96

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#96)	151

[narr]You put your finger on the trigger and never take it away.
The cupboard has blood stains on it.
The doors open, overexposed by an unknown weight.
A child corpse falls to the ground. You don't take time to look at it and keep searching for the man you are looking for.

	1- Go through the corridor.
	// char1 = Evelynn
	// char3 = Unknown Man
	//97

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#97)	152

[narr] As you step into the corridor, a man flatten you and starts to hit your face with his fists.
[char3]YOU KILLED MY BOY! HE WAS 4 YEARS OLD! 
He continues to hit you harder.
You cannot grab your gun and your face turns white to red because of the blood.
You feel like this is the end but try to struggle!
[main]I'M THE CHOSEN ONE!
[narr]In a short time, the overwhelming force vanished. A spray of blood covers your body and the man becomes a heavy dead corpse that falls on you, taking your breath away. Your eyes stare at the entrance for a while. Your savior takes his mask off... it's <char1>. She pushes the body of the loud man from yours and drags you to a wall where you can stay a bit.
[char1]I'm going to take a look for medication.
[narr]She leaves and heads for the cave.

	// GO TO 98

(#98) 153


[narr]You can hear a mother begging to stay alive while her child cries. 
[char1]Do you have a first-aid medkit? If so, WHERE?
[narr]It takes only a few seconds for her to get a response. You can hear two bursts straight after. <char1> bring a briefcase and start to heal a bit of your wounds by taking away your mask.
[char1]Your face is pretty ugly. Your nose is broken and your face won't be able to recover completely. You'll have a scar on half of your face.
[main]It doesn't matter to me. I will remain as I'm: a Chosen One. Nothing can really take me that out.
[char1]Quit that with me... Will you? Even the Great Preacher was never beat that much. 
You look like someone who comes out of a fight club.
[main]Brad Pitt is nothing in comparison.
[char1]Ah that movie! Didn't watch it...
[narr]A call on the talkie interrupts the conversation. The last sheeps of Oklahoma City are hiding in a veterinary hospital. The center of the nest of the plague.
[main]I'm about to live... Leave I mean. Are you with me, or not?
[char1]Sorry but I need to make a couple adjustments to my wounds too.
[narr]She sits and changes her bandage on the left calf. She was shot by a bullet.
[main]Well thank you for the help and see you after the crusade is done.
[char1]Sure thing, Chosen One!

1- Go to the headquarters of Oklahoma City.

(#99)	154

[narr]You are getting out and heading for the headquarters, ensuring to purify everything that is not white.
You meet the rest of the cult in a house not far from the enemy's base. They are preparing explosives.
You take a grenade in your hand.
[main]Shoot and throw everything you got at them! Don't stop until only ashes remain!
FIRE!
[narr]A rain of grenades and bullets are covering the building, that quickly becomes a souvenir. You step on it and ask to block the entrances.
[main]Each person found should be brought to an immediate state of death. Light up your torch, sharp your knife and reload your guns.
Tonight, we hunt the last waste of Oklahoma!
Let them be FAITHFUL!!

[narr]After a night of liberation, you are warned of the arrival of the Great Preacher in Oklahoma City and he wants to talk to you. He's located not far from the entrance of the city.
...
At your sight, he makes you a sign to approach.
[char4]You can take away your mask, my child.
[narr]You almost forgot about it since how involved you were on your journey.
[main]I can't let you see my horrible face, <char4>.
[narr]The <char4> doesn't understand why he should be dumbstruck and repeat his demands.
[main]It will be done as you wish.
[narr]You reveal your face and begin your report.
The <char4> is amazed by your feat of arms and wishes you to become his own descendant. You kneel down.
[main]Faithful, <char4>, I don't know what to tell!
[narr]Helping you to get up by lifting you with his arms, he looks at you.
A crowd gathers all around you.
[main]On the first day of our journey, we thought that we were home when everything was rotting aside. Today we are conquered by true freedom and wisdom.

(#200)	200

[char0]Ah <main>, how glad I am to see you!
[narr]You both enter a little basement in the area. <char0> sighs, something seems to bother him and fixes you with a deep look.
[main]Is something wrong?
[char0]I don't know... I mean, yes.
[main]Listen, <char0> I'm really sorry. I thought you were dead! I... I didn't...
[char0]No, don't worry. All of that is not your fault. No need to talk about it.
[main]But... Why are you with these masked guys?!
[char0]It's a lure, most of them are from the US army forces and are my friends.
[main]A lure for what? And why are you here? I still can't believe it to find you here, so far from Los Angeles while I thought you were dead.
[char0]So do I? 

	1 - Then, what are you doing in Dallas?
	// 201

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#201)	201

[char0]I told you that we had to leave Los Angeles but I'm even not sure where we could be safe...
Dallas has become a crossing point, a sort of custom to reach the East Coast. After the Los Angeles ambush, I called an old colleague of military service to help me.
Fortunately, I still have a good reputation in this entourage and I was helicoptered two days ago to capture this crossing point. In some ways, I could say that I resumed service.
[narr]You listen to <char0> attentively and surprised by what he's saying.
[char0]Actually, the East Coast seems safe but not for a long time. Reinforcements for ambush should come to Oklahoma City and start to seize more cities.
[main]Damn... We are finished!
[char0]No we are not. Well, do you still have my gun?
[main]Yes, I do. You sound like if you had a bad idea, I don't like that.
[char0]Great, you'll need it.

	1 - Wow, easy! What do you mean?
	// GO TO 202
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#202)	202

[narr]He takes a breath, fists firmly supported on table. 
[char0]With my team we took position in Dallas and this passage point to avoid reinforcements to join the siege in Oklahoma City. 
[main]The siege?! Is Oklahoma City attacked by these crazy guys?
[char0]Yes. So we pretend to be cultists and trap everybody who comes here.
The siege shouldn't be long, the city still resists for now but it'll be too late if we don't react.
We still have a look at their actions and I know from experience that if we wait, it would resolve nothing and get worse.
They are smarter and more organized than we can think. They have a lot of means.
Look, there is no more network on mobile phones and the radio is parasitized by another frequency that sends propaganda messages everywhere in the country that is destined for... the faithful. They call them like that.
They consider themself as a community but it's a sect!
[main]No, no way! The radio said that the West Coast was the problem!
What is the meaning of this?
[char0]Unfortunately, it is beyond us, <main>. The problem actually is that they are installed in Lawton and Oklahoma City begins to undergo sieges. We can't wait longer.

[char0]It'll be dangerous but I need people I can trust in. Some of my friends will come but I stay discreet. I trust in you <main>. Even more than that, several people who tried to flee the West Coast died during their trip but you didn't. You have this gift in your blood, like me, you are a survivor.
You have to come with me and I want you with me. By the way, I would like that we take your bus to do this operation.

[char0]Alright, I hope it was a false alarm. We better go now, come on! 
I gather the others, see you next to the bus and be ready to leave.
[narr]You both run outside.
<char0> comes back with three of his friends, well armed. 
[char0]Let's go!
[narr]You begin to drive to Lawton, in silence.

[char0]Well, he's <char1> and she's <char2>, they'll help us for this mission. Guys, I'm the <main>'s big brother.
[narr]Without a word they nod to you.
[char0]Here, one mask for each of you. Keep it to don't reveal your identity and keep in mind to avoid the faithf... cultist.
[narr]The word Faithful clears the <char0>'s throat when saying it by mistake. You quickly look at the mask he gives you. It's white and mat, with a hole for each eye. It looks like a statue visage, without expression. The word LIKE is painted on it, with paint drips. However, it looks very well made. 
[char0]If we are confronted by them and it's too dangerous to attack, tell them that we are here for reinforcement.
[narr]You stay quiet, with a beating heart. Now, it's too late to back down. It's not a matter of what you can do but only what is going to happen when you will be at Lawton.
You arrive near Lawton and there are masked guys that control the entry of the city.
[main]Oh no, <char0>! Do I turn around?
[char0]Fuck! Don't, it's too late. It would be suspect and they would chase us. Keep drive in their direction. Everybody put on his mask!

[char3]Faithful.
[narr]Without knowing why, perhaps because of the stress, you repeat what he says.
[main]Faithful.
[char3]Your intention?
[narr]Even before you have time to think about what to say, <char0> answers him with a firm point.
[char0]We are here as reinforcement.
[narr]Quiet for a while, the <char3> has a look at your bus from the window, nods and lets you pass.
[char3]Okay. Faith in our Great Preacher, brother.

[narr]Vehicles and masked guys patrol in the mains streets. Sometimes you even may notice that little groups are not masked. Difficult to say what are the differences among them but they don't seem to only patrol. Their discussion looks important.
[main]Over there! This building, it's a school and it looks very well secured.
[char0]Mh... Maybe there is their communication equipment inside but I still don't see any antenna. They scramble most of the network. According to our research, it's around here.
[narr]For the first time, one of your team takes the speech.
[char2]We should stop in a discreet street. There is enough greenery to take a good position and watch your back. We better have a look inside.
[char0]Affirmative. You're right. Stop you there, <main>.

[narr]You stop the bus in a little street next to a garden park. <char0> take out an earpiece and give it to you.
[char0]Alright! <main>, take this. We'll all stay in contact. My leg is still painful so I'll cover you from the park with <char2> and <char1>'ll come with you.
Fortunately, even with the scrambler communication, we shouldn't have problems communicating.
Listen everybody. By any way, we have to inform Oklahoma City when we succeed to destroy their communication equipment, so I took a rocket launcher. This is the mission. 
Some people are waiting for the good timing to not be attacked during their assault. The surprise effect has to be perfect and we will have only one chance.

[char4]We took position. Over.
[narr]You approach the school, eyes meet behind the white masks and you go nearrier unnoticed. With a discreet look, you may see several people inside and a scream come from the inside.

One gunshot, another scream, then followed by two more.

[narr]You acquiesce and help the other guys to carry heavy boxes into the school.
Through the school, you understand that it is now a strategic point for their supply. Inside, a clear radio is diffused as propaganda.
[radio]... our preacher dreamed of another name. Faith in our great preacher. Be faithful, not a sinner...
[narr]You follow the step behind another masked guy, fearing to lose <char1> of your sight among all of them.

[narr]The radio is suddenly louder. The Gustav Mahler symphony No. 5 is played and resonates in school's corridors. It's grandiose and masterful that it gives you goosebumps.
Everybody runs outside in the hurry to see the Great Preacher.
<char1> and you couldn't expect that and you are both alone in the room.
[char0]Holy shit! There is enough to irradiate a whole country. Look at this! It's a fucking box of C-4!

[char1]Too late, <char0>. It's our plan B. Over.
[narr]He instals a C-4 in the school, looking forward to blowing it all up, remote control in hand. <char1>, smiling, looks at you and asks you to follow him. You both enjoy the situation of the empty school because of the Great Preacher arrival.
He opens the exit door of the back and a view emerges on antennas and other mobile installations.

An indelible mark that emerges from the depths of your consciousness as an invisible presence that declares itself to you today. Without really knowing why, you are convinced that it is the Great Preacher who is at the other end of the line. His ataraxic voice puts you in a stupor similar to that of a prey in front of its predator. You are the object of a will that surpasses you.

And when the opportunity presents, it is difficult to make a fine mouth.

Like every morning, the jailers come to hammer the bars to wake up the prisoners. Psalmodizing their hymn, revering their Great Preacher, insulting and humiliating the latecomers and finally tearing us out of our cells. You may have noticed on your way to the workshop that indeed, the fanatics were more active than usual. An impression that will be verified when you are in the workshop making ammunition.

[narr]Luckily one of the boxes had been left relatively empty to give you enough room to slide in. From inside the crate, all you can hear are muffled noises. Shouting, arguing. Maybe worse. But it's too late to worry about that now. The minutes here seem to be hours. The waiting gets harder and harder as the seconds go by. 

Then finally the moment of deliverance. 
The truck's engine purrs, you feel its vibrations. The relief you feel moves you to tears. Thank God they didn't check the ammunition boxes. You never thought that this plan would work, you even resigned yourself to suffer the consequences. 
But freedom was not planned. A whirlwind of guilt overwhelms you. You are now out of this hell. The overflow of emotion tires you, you fall asleep naturally.

[narr]You emerge violently from sleep, awakened by the apprehension of still being in prison. You make sure you get out of the ammunition box discreetly. The truck's container is padlocked. You are caught in a panic. You hadn't considered that the container would be locked. You can't wait for the truck to arrive at its destination, you're going to have to try to manage the driver on your own.

Maybe it would have been more relevant with the song Deep Purple. The driver immediately stops the bus. You are standing near the exit and you can hear the footsteps converging towards the exit. 

The distinctive rattle of the unlocking can be heard. Adrenaline rushes immediately. The rear curtain suddenly lifts, revealing a stunted driver.

How can they let this kind of package be delivered by a kid that age. The latter silently recites a prayer, begging to the Great Preacher to save his soul. It is difficult to translate but you can feel the young man trembling with fear.

You arrive at one of these outposts where a gathering of armed soldiers is waiting for you. They hold their weapons firmly.

[narr]As you get out of the bus, you naturally raise your arms in the air. Two men armed with M16s approach you. 
[char3]Identify yourself, sir. You don't look like a cultist yet, you are walking around with one of their trucks. What's in it?

[char3]Indeed, it will be more useful to us than to them. You are?
[main]Miller. I drove all the way from Los Angeles to come here. You can't imagine how reassured I am that there are still safe places left in the country.

[main]What's wrong?
[char3]The problem is that you're coming out of one of their camps, sir. But I'm not the one who needs convincing. Follow us without asking questions.
[narr]The soldier's gaze hardens. He firmly grasps his M16 as if to send you a message.

(#608) 608 // Follow the two soldiers.

[narr]You walk along the wall of a veterinary hospital converted into a fortified base and enter a small deserted street, surrounded by ditches and fields.

The huge hall offered a curious sight. A myriad of screens dot the walls of the hall as well as a communication team. Military communication, CCTV feed back, strategic map of Oklahoma City and its surroundings.

Much of the information and orders seem to pass through here. Two sergeants, dressed in their half red and half blue jackets, were sentries in front of a low, closed door that could be seen in the background.

A former operating room refurbished as an interrogation room. A crude table lamp, placed on a black table, illuminated the resigned face of the major and the infinitely less calm face of his officer.
[char1]Miller, I presume. I was informed that you arrived here in a sect supply bus. Freshly stolen.
[main]You have been well informed.
[char1]I have a question that will seem strange to you. 

1 - I am listening.
// 609

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#609) 609 // I am listening.

[narr]The Major cast an oblique and worried glance at you.
[char1]Have you heard of Rafe Miller?
[narr]You are seized by a deaf sense of guilt. The turmoil of your journey quickly made you forget where it all started.
[char1]You know him for sure. Your expression lets me predict the worst.
[main]He died in Los Angeles. Shot while trying to protect Evelynn. All this... for nothing.
[char1]You're alive, that's certainly enough for your brother.
[narr]The journey took place in a melancholy disposition that suits you too well to be a painful feeling; but now that the goal had been achieved at the cost of the lives and freedom of others it had all turned into bitterness.
[char1]Believe me, it is too early to mourn the dead, Miller. We have so much to do before we start to settle. Let's start at the beginning: why are you in a sect's supply truck full of ammunition?

1 - This truck was my ticket out of Dallas prison.
// 610
2 - I hijacked it on the road.
// 611

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#610) 610 // This truck was my ticket out of Dallas prison.

[char1]You mean Indoctrination camp?
[narr]He added, pressing that last word, and throwing a penetrating glance at you, which escaped between his long black eyebrows, like the blade of a dagger shining out of the scabbard.
[main]What are you implying?
[char1]What I'm implying is that I've rarely seen anyone come out of the Dallas camp without losing their head in the process. 

1 - I don't think it works like that.
// 613
2 - I didn't stay long enough to become a devotee.
// 612

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#611) 611 // I hijacked it on the road

[char1]A splendid initiative, if you ask me. Can you tell me more about it?

1 - Dallas's camp is used to produce ammunition. They use the prisoners to manufacture them
// 618
2 - The truck I stole was to refuel Lawton to strengthen the city.
// 617
3 - The Great Preacher is on his way to Dallas. They are mobilizing their troops for his arrival.
// 616

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#612) 612 // I didn't stay long enough to become a devotee.  

[char1]And how am I supposed to be sure of that? I owe a lot to your brother but recent events make me have to be very careful.
[main]I'm hauling a shabby bus from Los Angeles, I lose my brother shot by a poorly trained security team, I'm repeatedly attacked by cults and bandits, find out that my sister-inlaw has converted to the cult and preaches the good word by capturing travelers, and now I'm a threat to national security?
[narr]The Major listened anxiously to your plea marking the end of your sentence with a warm, heavy breath.
[char1]Evelynn is a part of the cultists ? Listen, tell me everything you've learned.

1 - The Great Preacher is on his way to Dallas. They are mobilizing their troops for his arrival.
// 616
2 - The truck I stole was to refuel Lawton to strengthen the city.

// 618

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#613) 613 // I don't think it works like that.

[char1]Because you know how it works, don't you? Civilians who yesterday were going to work and enjoying the weekend to frolic in front of the TV suddenly become breakers all unified by a cause that escapes them? 
[main]So you tell yourself to whoever wants to hear that you welcome all the survivors and then say that it's likely to be a potential cultist?
[narr]He stood up on his seat and put his hands firmly on the black table.
[char1]What I am saying is that recent events push me to take precautions and to carefully study all the options and opportunities before us. I don't know if you've noticed, but we're clearly not at an advantage, Miller. The sect is taking place around the city and waiting for us to slowly suffocate. Their strategies are nothing like anything I have experienced before. They can turn your neighbor into guerrillas singing the Song of the Great Preacher at the top of their voices. 

1 - I can fuck off, if it suits you and reassures you. 
// 614
2 - So what next? You're keeping me in isolation?
// 615

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#614) 614 // I can fuck off, if it suits you and reassures you.  

[narr]He ran his hand over her pale face.
[char1]Let's try to be reasonable, tell me everything you've learned so far.

// 618
2 - The truck I stole was to refuel Lawton to strengthen the city.

[char1]So their supply line always passes through Dallas. This means that if we manage to isolate Dallas and neutralize their base there, we prevent them from gaining ground. And ammunition means gunpowder, which makes us perfect attack points. Interesting, what else?

[char1]So Lawton is less secure than before. That's not bad, do you have more information?

[char1]I'm going to ask you some questions. Answer them as clearly as possible. If I have the slightest doubt about you, you will be scheduled for the next firing squad. First, what were you doing in a supply truck belonging to the cult?

1 - I slipped into one of their trucks to get out of their prison. It was the only opportunity I had.
// 710

(#711) 711 // Follow the two soldiers. 

[narr]You walk along the wall of a veterinary hospital converted into a fortified base and enter a small deserted street, surrounded by ditches and fields.

The huge hall offered a curious sight. A myriad of screens dot the walls of the hall as well as a communication team. Military communication, CCTV feed back, strategic map of Oklahoma City and its surroundings.

[char1]Miller, I presume. I was informed that you arrived here in a sect supply bus. Freshly stolen. 
[main]You have been well informed.
[char1]I have a question that will seem strange to you.

1 - I am listening.
// 713

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#710) 710 // I slipped into one of their trucks to get out of their prison. It was the only opportunity I had. 

[char1]How long are you in this prison for?
[main]For a few weeks now. They ambushed us at one of the checkpoints in Dallas. I managed to get out of it with the help of other people.
[narr]The major nods to his officer. Nodding slightly, the officer exits the interrogation room, carefully closing the door. The Major gathers his two hands on the table and gives you a worried look.
[char1]You look like someone I know. You look like him. Rafe Miller? Are you his brother?
[narr]Hearing the name here causes you to feel a stupor followed closely by a deep sense of guilt.
[char1]I've got my answer. Did he make it through?

1 - No... he died in Los Angeles during the putsch. He helped me get through it.
// 712

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#713) 713 // I am listening.

[narr]The Major cast an oblique and worried glance at you.
[char1]Have you heard of Rafe Miller?
[narr]You are seized by a deaf sense of guilt. The turmoil of your journey quickly made you forget where it all started.
[char1]You know him for sure. Your expression lets me predict the worst.
[main]He died in Los Angeles. Shot while trying to protect Evelynn. All this... for nothing. [char1]You're alive, that's certainly enough for your brother.
[narr]The journey took place in a melancholy disposition that suits you too well to be a painful feeling; but now that the goal had been achieved at the cost of the lives and freedom of others it had all turned into bitterness.
[char1]Believe me, it is too early to mourn the dead, Miller. We have so much to do before we start to settle. Let's start at the beginning: why are you in a sect's supply truck full of ammunition?

1 - I hijacked it on the road.
// 714
2 - This truck was my ticket out of Dallas prison.

1 - The Great Preacher is on his way to Dallas. They are mobilizing their troops for his arrival.
// 719
2 - The truck I stole was to refuel Lawton to strengthen the city.
// 720
3 - Dallas's camp is used to produce ammunition. They use the prisoners to manufacture them.
// 721
4 - I was able to exchange with the Great Preacher on the radio.
// 722

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#715) 715 // This truck was my ticket out of Dallas prison.

[char1]You mean Indoctrination camp?
[narr]He added, pressing that last word, and throwing a penetrating glance at you, which escaped between his long black eyebrows, like the blade of a dagger shining out of the scabbard.
[main]What are you implying?
[char1]What I'm implying is that I've rarely seen anyone come out of the Dallas camp without losing their head in the process.

1 - I didn't stay long enough to become a devotee.
// 716
2 - I don't think it works like that.
// 717

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#714) 714 // I hijacked it on the road 

[char1]A splendid initiative, if you ask me. Can you tell me more about it?

1 - The Great Preacher is on his way to Dallas. They are mobilizing their troops for his arrival.
//719
2 - The truck I stole was to refuel Lawton to strengthen the city.
// 720
3 - Dallas's camp is used to produce ammunition. They use the prisoners to manufacture them.
// 721
4 - I was able to exchange with the Great Preacher on the radio.
// 722

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#716) 716 // I didn't stay long enough to become a devotee.  

[char1]And how am I supposed to be sure of that? I owe a lot to your brother but recent events make me have to be very careful. 
[main]I'm hauling a shabby bus from Los Angeles, I lose my brother shot by a poorly trained security team, I'm repeatedly attacked by cults and bandits, find out that my sister-inlaw has converted to the cult and preaches the good word by capturing travelers, and now I'm a threat to national security?
[narr]The Major listened anxiously to your plea marking the end of your sentence with a warm, heavy breath.
[char1]Evelynn is a part of the cultists ? Listen, tell me everything you've learned.

1 - I was able to exchange with the Great Preacher on the radio.
// 722
2 - Dallas's camp is used to produce ammunition. They use the prisoners to manufacture them.
// 721
3 - The truck I stole was to refuel Lawton to strengthen the city.
// 720
4 - The Great Preacher is on his way to Dallas. They are mobilizing their troops for his arrival.
// 719

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#717) 717 // I don't think it works like that. 

[char1]Because you know how it works, don't you? Civilians who yesterday were going to work and enjoying the weekend to frolic in front of the TV suddenly become breakers all unified by a cause that escapes them? 
[main]So you tell yourself to whoever wants to hear that you welcome all the survivors and then say that it's likely to be a potential cultist? 
[narr]He stood up on his seat and put his hands firmly on the black table.
[char1]What I am saying is that recent events push me to take precautions and to carefully study all the options and opportunities before us. I don't know if you've noticed, but we're clearly not at an advantage, Miller. The sect is taking place around the city and waiting for us to slowly suffocate. Their strategies are nothing like anything I have experienced before. They can turn your neighbor into guerrillas singing the Song of the Great Preacher at the top of their voices. 

1 - So what next? You're keeping me in isolation?
// 718
2 - I can fuck off, if it suits you and reassures you. 
// 751

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

[narr]The major looks at you with as much astonishment as fear.
[char1]I thought there was no such thing as a Great Preacher. No one has ever confirmed his existence to us except the cultivators themselves. But he never appeared publicly as a lie made up to scare the crowds. 
[main]It's hard to say what he might look like but he had a good chat with me. I couldn't tell what he looked like except that I was uncomfortable. Even through an intermediary communicator, I felt his presence. I doubt this guy is just a hooded guru.
[narr]It was difficult to explain in words what you felt during the exchange. You could have been thrown in jail if you had gone any further. But there was no mockery in the Major's eyes, he took your testimony with the utmost seriousness.
[char1]It is difficult to describe a man capable of causing such upheaval, I imagine. There are things we still don't know about him, I imagine that the truth behind it will be hard to admit... What more can you teach me?

[narr]It's 1:00 a.m. Lawton. A school converted into a base of operations. Patrols in reduced formation. 2 or 3 people maximum. The wooded campus offers enough cover to walk to school without being spotted. The major deploys the campus map. 
[char1]We're going to split up into several squads. Alpha team, you target the building behind the athletic field. He's moving all their ammo to that location. Set the explosives and wait for my signal to detonate the charges.

[narr]The main building appears as an isolated block in front of which enemy patrols are positioned in isolated teams. No more than three people per patrol team, which leaves a good opportunity to strike if tempted so that no alarm is sounded.

[char1]We cannot be certain that they are in a weak position and we must find a way to limit human losses. We are not as numerous as they are. 
[main]So we act as guerrillas. 
[char1]Do you have a better proposal? 
[main]Nothing more than their training is tight, do not hesitate to neutralize them discreetly if possible. 
[char1]You should have started with that. Alpha Team and Tango 2 Team evolves to their goal by eliminating the patrols that passed by. 

1 - Observe building windows.
// 826

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#826) 826 	// Observe building windows. 

[narr]On the roof of the building, an insulated sentry. It can quickly escalate the situation if not neutralized. You can neutralize it. 
[main]If I remember what Rafe taught me, I estimate the size of the target and the distance using the scope. The target must be about... 1m75 and on the telescope, it's the telescope that indicates 2 Mrad. So to calculate the distance, I divide the size and the mrad then I multiply by 1000, which makes us... 

1 - 875 meters away.
// 875

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#827) 827	 // 875 meters away. 

[narr]You readjust your bezel to the calculated distance and slowly squeeze the trigger to avoid shaking. The detonated shot is muffled by the silencer placed on the barrel. The sentry on the roof falls heavily on the ground. 
[char1]Nice shot, Marksman 1. Do you see other isolated units? 
[main]Affirmative, I see two others, one not far from Alpha Team and one at the window of the main building. 
[char1]Start neutralizing the one on the Alpha team's side. 
[main]Roger that. The target is 1m85 tall and my bezel is adjusted 1Mrad... which makes us approximately. 

1 - 1850 meters away.
// 829
2 - 850 meters away.
// char4 = Marksman 2
// 828

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#828) 828 	// 850 meters away. 

[narr]Again, you adjust your shot according to the distance and gently squeeze the trigger. The bullet whistled into the target's ear and pierced one of the trees in the park at the back of the building. As the sentinels begin to understand what has just happened, a second detonation is heard. The sentry is struck between the two eyes and falls to the ground.
[char4]Be careful, Marksman 1, the slightest mistake and the alert is sounded. I'm not going to be able to help you on Alpha Team's target, so be very careful.
[main]Rodger. The last target is at the window. A size 1m80 for 2Mrad... 
[narr]But the wind is starting to pick up. Fortunately for you, the area is wooded and allows you to estimate the wind speed. The leaves barely rustle. 
[main]The wind must be at 3 knots, which means that I will have to climb the distance of 300 meters. 1m80, 2Mrad... 

1 - 900 meters away. 
// 830
2 - 1200 meters away.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#829) 829 	// 1850 meters away.

[narr]Again, you adjust your shot according to the distance and gently squeeze the trigger. The shot relentlessly pierces the skull of the cultist collapsing to the ground like a disarticulated doll. 
[char1]Clean and precise. You have one last target left, Marksman 1. 
[main]The last target is at the window. A size 1m80 for 2Mrad... But the wind is starting to pick up. Fortunately for you, the area is wooded and allows you to estimate the wind speed. The leaves barely rustle. 
[main]The wind must be at 3 knots, which means that I will have to climb the distance of 300 meters. 1m80, 2Mrad... 

1 - 900 meters away. 
// 830
2 - 1200 meters away.
// char4 = Team Alpha
// 831
3 - 1800 meters away.
// 832

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#832) 832 	// 1800 meters away.

[narr]The ball just misses its target and ricochets off the wall behind. The brick of the window comes to alert everyone. The battle shakedown had sounded. It was an inexpressible scramble, one of those confused battles where all rush, soldiers and captains, to save their skins, deafened, blinded, no longer having a clear awareness of the situation. Behind the stupor of the fight then came the calm embalming blood and gunpowder. 

1 - Continue.
// 838

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(#831) 831 	// 1200 meters away.

[narr]As always, you adjust the bezel and its position. Gently squeezing the trigger the shot comes perfectly hitting the skull. The bri of the window comes to surprise a patrol below. But this moment of surprise will allow the Tango team to seize the opportunity to neutralize them. 
[char1]A magnificent shot. Well done, Marksman 1. Stay in position and watch the surroundings. We are progressing in the school. 
[char4]We found the gun dump. We're planting the explosives. 

1 - If we succeed, what's next? 
// 833
2 - Why not just get the weapons back?
// 834

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#833) 833 	// If we succeed, what's next?

[char1]We dismantle and recover Lawton on our own account and we take advantage of this position to reorganize this counteroffensive. Oklahoma City is ready to send troops in response to this. 

1 - Dallas is even better guarded than Lawton, you really do have a plan. 
// 835
2 - So you plan to occupy Lawton?
// 836

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#834) 834 	// Why not just get the weapons back?

[char1]We wouldn't have enough hands to use it and the goal would be to dismantle this site as quickly as possible. Then the counter-offensive is launched in Dallas. 

1 - So you plan to occupy Lawton?
// 836
2 - Dallas is even better guarded than Lawton, you really do have a plan.
// 835

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#835) 835 	// Dallas is even better guarded than Lawton, you really do have a plan.

[char1]A lot of infantry in a position has never been a strategic advantage. The coming of their guru offers us an unexpected opportunity to break that siege. 
[main]So we launch a counteroffensive immediately?
[char1]Indeed. The communication room is located. We have neutralized the hostiles. 

1 - I don't see any reinforcements at the moment, everything is quiet.
// 837

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#836) 836 	// So you plan to occupy Lawton?

[char1]Indeed. Lawton will serve as a front post to control the supply routes. By admitting that one manages to dismantle this site then that of Dallas, I doubt that the sect will leave nicely. 
[main]It's going to be difficult to live safely anyway
[char1]Indeed. The communication room is located. We have neutralized the hostiles.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#837) 837 	// I don't see any reinforcements at the moment, everything is quiet.

[char1]We set the explosive charges. On my mark, Alpha Team. 
[char4]Waiting. 
[char1]Now. 
[narr]A deaf explosion was heard, and much less vivid than had been supposed. The battle shakedown had sounded. It was an inexpressible scramble, one of those confused battles where all rush, soldiers and captains, to save their skins, deafened, blinded, no longer having a clear awareness of the situation. Behind the stupor of the fight then came the calm embalming blood and gunpowder. 

1 - Continue.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#838) 838 	// Continue. 

[narr]Christ weeps over the iniquitous wars of which America becomes the bloody arena. It has been one month since the assault on Dallas. A death procession. For almost a month we had been living in a soft premature spring. The Skirvin Hilton occupies a large, well exposed building surrounded by a park. As you enter, you are greeted with great deference by a patrol that had just taken duty. You go to the middle of the central hallway, where the rooms look out onto. Room 704. 

1 - Enter the room.
// 839

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#839) 839 	// Enter the room. 

[narr]The bedroom door locked on the outside, the shutters of the only window closed, too, on the outside, and, over the shutters, the bars intact, bars through which you would not have passed your arm. And on a waxed chair sat a woman with a pale face silently chanting prayers. There was something solemn about hearing, in that dark room, the faint voice of that woman, telling of deeds, prayers and death. You grab a chair in the corner of the room and stand in front of the woman. She seems to act as if you don't exist.

[main]Hello, Evelynn. 
[narr]She had refused to say a word for several weeks. But she had started eating her meals again and some had noticed brief moments of lucidity. 

1 - What's on your mind, Evelynn? 
// 841
2 - I heard you were eating again.
// 840

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#840) 840 	// I heard you were eating again.

[narr]Looking mechanically at the empty plate on the coffee table, she sighed. 
[main]It's a good sign, you're getting back on track. 
[narr]She struggles to hide her emotionality. 
[main]I have the impression that despite everything, things are moving in the right direction. I don't have to worry anymore because you might die at the end. And Rafe, where he is, doesn't have to worry anymore either. 
[char5]I miss him.

1 - I miss him too.
// 842 
2 - So why did you join them?
// 843

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#841) 841	// What's on your mind, Evelynn? 

[narr]She had a hard time pretending not to understand your question. 
[main]Still praying to the Great Preacher hoping for a solution from him, aren't you? 
[narr]His face betrayed his irritability.
[main]Rafe died because of an asshole like him and you still think the solution will come from him. 
[char5]You felt it, you must be able to understand me. 

1 - What I understood was that it was more dangerous than I could have imagined. 
// 844
2 -  Yes, but because of him Rafe is dead. No matter the beautiful promises and sighs.
// 845

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(#842) 842		// I miss him too.

[char5] You know, I know that from the outside, the situation may seem ridiculous... 
[main]I know you've been through some very difficult things. You more than anyone can understand what I've been through. 
[char5]I don't understand. He chose you. Yet you refused. 

1 - I would like you to answer some of my questions, Eve.
846 //

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#843) 843	// So why did you join them?

[char5]You know why I joined them, you refuse to admit it. 
[main]Admit what? That a guy who whispers pretty words didn't convince me? That this same guy organizes putsches and raids and then goes off in a rhetoric of world peace?! 
[char5]You know very well that it's much more complex than that... 
[main]I know it's very complex but I'm just questioning the reasoning behind it, that's all. And so should you, Eve. 
[char5]I don't know... 

1 - I would like you to answer some of my questions, Eve.
// 846

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#844) 844	// What I understood was that it was more dangerous than I could have imagined.

[narr]A pearl tear. She stared at you at last. 
[main]It will take as long as it takes, but I think you'll come to understand how ridiculous this story is, Eve. 
[char5]I am... 
[main]Unifying the world by killing the rest in the process, nothing serious in that. Superior entity or not, you can't decently think that this is the solution. 
[char5]He didn't just appear out of nowhere, you know? 

1 - I would like you to answer some of my questions, Eve.
// 846

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#845) 845	// Yes, but because of him Rafe is dead. No matter the beautiful promises and sighs.

[char5]He is not the one who killed Rafe and you know it as well as I do. Nothing was going on in this country before all this. You see things through blinkers. 
[main]So launching a putsch in Los Angeles certainly had nothing to do with Rafe's death? [char5]I am... 

1 - I would like you to answer some of my questions, Eve.
// 846

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#846) 846		// I would like you to answer some of my questions, Eve.

 [char5]I am listening. 

1 - Have you ever met the Great Preacher?
// 847 
2 - The Great Preacher has a real name?
// 849

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#847) 847	// Have you ever met the Great Preacher?
 
[char5]Several times, the last one was in Dallas. 
[main]I just wonder what he looks like? 
[char5]It has many appearances. The last time I saw him, he looked like a teenager with wheat blond hair. Before that, I saw him as a mature woman, also blonde. 
[main]Wait, he's changing his appearance? 
[char5]Still but it retains certain characteristics. He still has blond hair. 

1 -  Does he or she have a name other than the one you give him or her?
// 848

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#849) 849	// The Great Preacher has a real name?

[char5]It has two other names, from what I could understand.
[main]Which ones?
[char5]Louis Cyphre or Louisa Ferra.

1 - Wait, but what does he or she look like?
// 850 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
(#848) 848 	// Does he or she have a name other than the one you give him or her?

[char5]It has two other names, from what I know. 
[main]Which ones? 
[char5]Louis Cyphre or Louisa Ferra. 

1 - I confess that all this is completely beyond me.
 // 851

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#850) 850	// Wait, but what does he or she look like?
 [char5]It has many appearances. The last time I saw him, he looked like a teenager with wheat blond hair. Before that, I saw him as a mature woman, also blonde. 
[main]Wait, he's changing his appearance? 
[char5]Still but it retains certain characteristics. He still has blond hair. 

1 - I confess that all this is completely beyond me.
// 851

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#851) 851	// I confess that all this is completely beyond me.

[char5]You really think you can do something about it? 
[main]At least we'll try. I hope that in time you will understand that all this was absurd, Eve.
[char5]I hope it's you who will understand that all this is doomed to fail. The people have called for the coming of the Great Preacher. This is the will of all of us. 
[main]I am willing to make the effort to prove you wrong. Letting apathy and ease win at the expense of our own will, very little for me. 

1 - Leave the place.
// 852 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(#852) 852  // Leave the place
. 
[main]I'm going to leave, Eve. I only hope that at some point you will understand the extent of your mistake. 
[narr]Evelynn remained silent, staring at the light rays filtering through the bars of her window. From the beginning of spring and this long epic, there was hope. One that is reflected in daily benevolence, even when the situation is desperate. The resonance of Oklahoma's victory echoed throughout the land that has become the symbol of free will.
