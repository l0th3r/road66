[narr]Facing the Oklahoma Cityâ€™s walls, behind you in the sky, the distant sound of an airplane approaches.
[main]Today, we get rid of the dirty daemons. Our faith is bigger than ever! We will be remembered my brothers! Safety will be our reward my sisters! God is watching us, childrens. You make him proud!
WE ARE FAITHFUL AND GOD BLESS AMERICA!
[narr]You put a white mask on your head.
On these words, the plane dives and hits the wall in a deafening sound followed by the howl of a thousand people ready to annihilate the garbage of this world.
