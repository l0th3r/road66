[narr]You run to the pierced wall, gun in hand. Crossing the flames and rubbles caused by the crash, several corpses of men, women and childrens are lying in front of you. They are only dust compared to your important duty.
You run on them like if they were nothing to you. Several people are running away in the street above, entrapped by houses.
You aim them and shoot as much as you can, reloading, shooting again...
[main]Charge!
[narr]The army is now infiltrating the city like a blast of air entering a piece and disinfecting it. You move furthermore in the bastion.
However, the backlash of such a thoughtless strategy is rapidly hurting you. A troop of soldiers is making a barricade of shoots on your entrance and you need to act quickly before taking them down.
