[narr] As you step into the corridor, a man flatten you and starts to hit your face with his fists.
[char3]YOU KILLED MY BOY! HE WAS 4 YEARS OLD! 
He continues to hit you harder.
You cannot grab your gun and your face turns white to red because of the blood.
You feel like this is the end but try to struggle!
[main]I’M THE CHOSEN ONE!
[narr]In a short time, the overwhelming force vanished. A spray of blood covers your body and the man becomes a heavy dead corpse that falls on you, taking your breath away. Your eyes stare at the entrance for a while. Your savior takes his mask off... it’s <char1>. She pushes the body of the loud man from yours and drags you to a wall where you can stay a bit.
[char1]I’m going to take a look for medication.
[narr]She leaves and heads for the cave.
