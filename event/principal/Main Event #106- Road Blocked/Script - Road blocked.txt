(#0)

[narr]500 miles before Oklahoma City.
Abandoned vehicles block the entire width of the road. The sight of this panorama makes you feel a violent desolation that you have never felt before.
You can keep going on a road that drives you to the South and a panel says: Dallas - 496 miles.
[main]Here we go for a little detour!
