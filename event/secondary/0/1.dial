[narr]The rumbling sound of the engine is slowly decreasing until it stops. You pull the brake, take away your belt and get up from your seat. After a quick look in the direction of your cargo, you open the doors of the bus. While your step touches the ground, a violent blow comes right in your face. You immediately close the eyes before realising the heat of the wind. The air is dry and the sum is hitting so much that you need to put your hand over your eyes to protect them.
You finally take a look at the car but the reflection of the sun blinds you. However, beneath the sand and dry dirt smelling, you start to smell something else. It's coming from the back of the car.
