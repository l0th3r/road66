[char1]They let me live and said that I should never have taken care of them. They left and I stayed here, powerless and unable to make a move. 
Until I heard my dog who was having a litter. She wasn't making a sound but she was still alive, her body riddled of bullets. I came to her, even if the ground was full of blood and my eyes full of tears. I saw that she wasn't going to survive. I take his head on my knees like I always did. She left me, killed by these animals. 
I cried a lot, drowned between despair and sadness and it was until I saw something moving in his belly.  
[main]Did anyone of them survive? 
[narr]Bils is looking, turning his head from the fire and directly pointing them into yours before looking at the puppy standing on his knees.
[char1]Since then, I took my car and arrived here. My gas tank is empty... Can you help me?
