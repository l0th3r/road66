[narr]You search for the reason of this weird smelling.
A man is sitted on a camping chair. He's half naked, wearing a blue jean, a white hat, alone and trying to make a fire. 
His dried mouth is covered with dust but you manage to see an extinguished cigar. He turns to you and smiles, showing his teeth, clean as if those were a bright window despite the dirt all over his chest.
[main]Well! If it's not a fellow partner for barbecue that we have here!
[narr]The man seems to need some help for the fire but before you ask anything, he'is crouching to blow a small fire that immediately comes to life and rises like a living creature. You realise a growling sound on your back and turn your head.
A dog accompanied him, a puppy. It's an Australian cattle dog, focused on you and showing teeth.
[char1]Come on Marina! Stop this mess and get over here!
[narr]The dog stops his growling before passing between your legs as you are nothing but an obstacle to cross for him. The man is stroking his pet and seems careful.
