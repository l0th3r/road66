[narr]You start talking to him about who he is and why he's standing here alone with his dog. He's starting to cook sausages as you are discussing. Nevertheless, he's telling you that his name is <char1> and starts to share his story with you. 
[char1]Ah, nice to meet you <main>!
[main]What are you doing here alone?
[char1]Ah... It's quite a long story to be honest. I've been fleeing for the past two days from my hometown that became... Radically different to tell the least.
You see... I used to be a dog breeder. I used to be with animals and nothing could get me happier. A strange cult was gaining more and more power. 
I wasn't really taking it like a problem you see. I think we can believe in what we wish and respect our choices but... not in that way. Sorry but I cannot just tell this to somebody, the scar is wild open in my heart.
[narr]The man is giving you cooked meat. 
[char1]Here, take it before it gets cold.
[main]Thank you, <char1>.
