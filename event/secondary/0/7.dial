[narr]You ask for sharing the complete story.
[char1]After the meal then.
[narr]You start eating your meat. It's good and it reminds you how precious your moments with your family are. It's only food but maybe it's more than that. The fire crackles and before it comes to ashes, <char1> takes a moment to feed his puppy and take him on his knees and pet him. He takes a breath and keeps telling you what happens to him.
[char1]Haha you see... My dog, the old one, had a litter. She was supposed to give birth to puppies this month. 
[narr]His voice is trembling and he's interrupting for a few seconds. 
[char1]Two days ago, I was with my dogs and we were in the middle of the afternoon in the garden. Nothing was different from the over days. Until there... until they came. They... were five. Five white figures that come to my front gate and they pull out their... guns. Dark machines of death and they point them on my dogs. One of them shouted: Faithful America! The noise... It's... Still in my head. Not from the guns but my dogs... My dogs... 
[narr]Tears appear all over his eyes.
