[narr]Your curiosity is too high to stop looking for the thing. You start to swim and follow the cries. After sometimes, it becomes louder and louder and you expect to find something that needs some help. Nevertheless, you succeed to reach the ever loading sound.
You discover <char0>, in a stoup. Her hair is blooming like waves and she doesn't seem to take yours into consideration. You try to talk to her but you aren't making a single sound.
She quickly opens your eyes. In a fraction of seconds, she reaches you. She sticks her eyes with yours. 
She doesn't make a move. After a few seconds, you heard her voice but her lips aren't moving.
She tells you to stop and hugs you. 
[char0]Start living without me and your brother.
[narr]You lose conscience and your mind...
You open your eyes, get up and look at the horizon. You feel... Lighter. The sun is rising. 
It's time to keep going on your journey. 
For the best or the worst.
