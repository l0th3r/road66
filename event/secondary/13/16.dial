[narr]You lack air and it's only once you really start to express yourself that you perceive the note tinted by regrets and rigidity.
Drown by the rancour of your own weakness, you notice that water had already raised all above and around you. You look for something before being taken by waters.
As you are searching for a way out, you manage to discover a small island of sand and reached it as fast as possible.
After getting your breath back, you take a look around yourself. You can only see water... Water everywhere.
You choose to look above and become aware of a written message on the sand: Souvenir.
They come back, like a racket of a thousand stepping horses and they hit you. They hit you so much that you wish to forget, you wish to do not consider what you think.
