[narr]You put all of your focus on yourself. The annoyment become only a dream on the sweet night of summer. You feel relieved and relaxed.
You take a look at the road and discover a person that is crossing the road.
...
You brake!
...
But you react too late. You didn't focus enough on the road and directly go into it. You get out of the car and go check on him. You try to get closer to make sure that he's alive. It's a man and he's laying down on the road. Blood is scattering all over himself.
You feel a bitter almost acid taste as you realize that the man in front of you is nothing else than <char1>, your brother.
Something else, a more powerful flow of energy is rising up to your eyes. The river is released and its water is as pure as the crystal yet full of salt.
They allow you to free constricted yet inaudible words from your strangle vocal cords like hoarse by an unusual pressure.
