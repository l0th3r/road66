[narr]The monstrous wave is coming to you. Full of doubts and regrets, you are facing your greatest challenge so far: acceptation of your faults.
As the water pound all over yourself, your limbs are ripped apart and your agony is so intense that even words are insufficient to describe it.

The water surrounds you. However, it's not the only thing that you feel. A presence, undescriptive and undeniable but somehow crying.
