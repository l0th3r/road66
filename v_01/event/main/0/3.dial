[narr]Downstair, <char0> join you with his pickup. 
[char0]Get in the car <main>! Take the wheel, you drive!
[main]What the hell <char0>?! What's happening?! 
[char0]One hour ago I was at work talking with an old friend. He is in the army. Like the OP marine kind of guy. He got an important call from his general. They are abandoning the region.
[main]Why is your wife not with us?
[char0]Well, <char1> is still working at the hospital. We have to go take her before we leave.
[main]Ok.
[narr]Outside, the situation is even worse than you have imagined. For the last few weeks, you've stayed locked in, as the government said. Now, on the streets you see people running, fighting, screaming. 
And... is that a dead body?
