[narr]BANG!
You killed <char0>. The crowd is terrified, looking at you.
[main]Get out of my way! I have to pass!
Everyone gets out of the road.
[narr]You go back to your bus. You start the engine. Some guys in the crowd shoot your bus with rifles. The bus is not damaged but <char1> is not spared by destiny, the bullet hits him and he dies.
