[main]Hello!
[narr]The music is loud, but you hear someone... groaning.
You take a look in the kitchen. It’s a woman, she's tied up.
A cloth was stuck in her mouth and she is groaning as loud as she can. She looks at you, like if there was hope in her eyes and she wanted to tell you something terrible.
You take off the cloth.
[char1]Get me out of here! Get me out of here! He… he’s gonna kill me!
